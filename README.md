# Physics-Review
My physics website.

I've had this idea for a while, my previous attempt using WordPad was not great, I felt the WordPad barrier reduced my use. I'm more optimistic about this method.

Steps:
Get Github Working Y
Create ReadME Y
Integrate LaTeX
Get Custom Domain
Pull Content from Wordpad + Laptop
Review Old Physics into LaTeX presentable form
