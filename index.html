<h1>Welcome to Physics-Review</h1>

    <p>Have you ever looked back on something you've learned and felt as though you don't understand it anymore? This is my journey after completing my physics degree revisiting all the physics I'm supposed to know. The hope is to better relate advanced physics with the principles seen in introductory physics. I'll be posting with content from textbooks and papers I'm reading, with problems, derivations, code, even tests! Feel free to follow along with my studies and learn physics from the ground up to empower future research.</p>
